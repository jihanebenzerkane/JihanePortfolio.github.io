# Jihane Benzerkane — Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio! I am an **AI & Digital Transformation Engineering Student** at **ENSA Al Hoceima**, Morocco. I am passionate about building production-ready systems that leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence.

## 🚀 About Me

I am a Third-year engineering student with a deep interest in:
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP.
- **Software Engineering**: Building robust REST APIs and full-stack applications.
- **Digital Transformation**: Strategies for integrating technology into practical solutions.

I believe in bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation. I'm a fast learner, an active open-source contributor, and always eager to solve meaningful problems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **AI/ML**: Python (FastAPI, Django), BERT, Transformers, HuggingFace.
- **Low-Level**: C, C++, Language Theory & Compilation (Flex, Bison).
- **Backend & Web**: PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Linux.

## 📁 Projects

- **[AI Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/jihanebenzerkane/Sentiment-Analysis-BERT)**: Multi-class sentiment analysis using BERT.
- **[JobTracker API](https://github.com/jihanebenzerkane/backend-API-job-Tracker)**: Full-stack application for managing job opportunities.
- **[DFA Compiler](https://github.com/jihanebenzerkane/Projet-Theorie-de-langage)**: A compiler for a custom language based on DFA theory.

## 🌊 Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- 📖 Reading and expanding my horizons.
- 🏊 Swimming to keep a balanced mind.
- 🧘 Contemplating and finding value in quiet moments.
